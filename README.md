### **Mythril Ore** (2023/02 ~ now)
 **Position:**
 - Full Stack Developer for my personal project
 - UI/UX desginer


**Role Overview:**
- In my dynamic role as a Developer, I undertook a comprehensive range of tasks aimed at addressing real-world challenges through innovative and efficient solutions. My journey began with a keen awareness of the problems faced, leading to the strategic selection of projects that held the potential to benefit not only myself but a wider audience.


**Key Responsibilities:**

* **🚀 Project Ideation and Selection:**
  *  Initiated projects based on identified problems, ensuring alignment with personal challenges and potential widespread issues.
  * Employed brainstorming sessions to generate creative ideas, evaluating their feasibility and impact.

* **👨‍💻 MVP Development and Design:**
  *  Conceptualized Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) by strategically determining necessary features.
  * Executed the initial design phase, creating a blueprint for projects on GitHub.
    
* **🌐 Database Design and Management:**
  * Designed databases and structured tables to seamlessly integrate with project requirements.
  * Ensured efficient backend operations and infrastructure using AWS through a process of trial and error.

* **🔧 Frontend Development and TypeScript Mastery:**
  * Utilized React for frontend development, enhancing TypeScript skills for clean code, well-organized props, and optimal API usage.
  * Focused on continuous improvement, incorporating best practices for TypeScript implementation.

* **🌟 UI/UX Research and Implementation:**
  * Conducted in-depth research on UI/UX design principles to create aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly SaaS products.
  * Applied acquired knowledge to enhance the overall design and user experience.

* **👀 Terraform:**
  * Proactively learned Terraform to optimize the management of AWS resources, streamlining infrastructure processes.
  * Leveraged Terraform for efficient and scalable AWS resource deployment.
 
* **Motivation Behind Creating the App**
  * My project revolves around a simple yet innovative to-do list concept with a unique twist. When creating a to-do list, you're not just jotting down tasks; you're also assigned a supporter. Drawing inspiration from my own experiences, I've always found it more motivating to tackle tasks when there's external responsibility or a bit of pressure involved. It's akin to the scenario where you're likely to clean your house more diligently when expecting a friend over.
  * The essence of this app is to assist individuals by connecting them with others who will act as accountabilities. The underlying idea is to leverage external motivation for better task management.
  * As it stands, this is just the MVP model, and I have a plethora of other features in mind that I aim to implement. Conducting interviews with various individuals has provided valuable insights into the factors that make tasks easier or harder to accomplish. With this understanding, my goal is to continue refining and expanding this project, helping people achieve their goals. After all, sometimes a gentle push from others is all we need to kickstart our endeavors.
